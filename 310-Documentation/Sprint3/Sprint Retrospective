The team now understands the small changes that need to be made to complete implementation. A large majority of the implementation is working, and the rest needs to be polished. Additionally, the team now understands what tests need to be written (largely login functionality black box tests) and can test new implementation accordingly. Essentially, the team will implement the small changes to modern UI (changing font sizes essentially), the grocery list (allow for deletion of items), previous query (make each button the collage and making the list have duplicate searches), and maintaining information (ensuring each user has their own previous query list). The team will then write black box tests for user login functionality and ensure that user login functionality is fully implemented.
As for this next sprint procedurally, we will be more diligent when proofreading our document. We will double check commit links and make sure dates are valid. We will allocate more time and effort into figuring out how to properly run Travis. Finally, our group will make sure we provide quantitative data for our simple design. We will make sure our refactorings are up to standard and pair programmings are more descriptive.
